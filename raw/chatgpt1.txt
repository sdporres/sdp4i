When people ask me where I am from, I like to tell them that I wasn’t born in Texas, but I got here as soon as I could. My first taste of Irving came as a student at the University of Dallas, but it was in 2014 that I was fortunate enough to call Irving "home."

I met my wife, Emily, in the Washington, D.C., area while she was completing her Master’s Degree in Psychology. About a year later, we were married. We started our family in Maryland and spent a few years in Indiana, but it was in Irving that we found the community we believe provides the best opportunities for our children. I am proud to say that four of my six children can claim to be Texans from birth.

Our first residence in Irving was near Brandenburg Elementary School, and it was there that we made friends we are grateful to still have a decade later. My career as a software engineer took us on a tour of the DFW area for a few years—including time in The Colony and Keller—before we returned to Irving in 2020.

My children are very different, which is no surprise, and one of the qualities we love about Irving is how it serves each of their interests. The Baila Dance Academy, Upward basketball league, Irving Soccer Complex, and Twin Wells fields are regular stops for our family and have also introduced us to new friends in the community.

Equally important are the school options in Irving. Our oldest is in middle school at Great Hearts, and for some of our other children, we have found wonderful co-ops that offer the flexibility we value. The diverse range of educational opportunities is one of the strengths of our community that we proudly share with our out-of-state friends.

My experience getting involved in the activities my children enjoy opened my eyes to how a community becomes great: through the involvement of its citizens. The schools, sports leagues, and dance recitals my children benefit from exist because people care and take the initiative to bring these programs to life. Through their participation, my children learn about themselves, discover and pursue their interests, and build relationships that are essential to a fulfilling life. These activities also enrich the adults involved, creating connections and fostering a sense of belonging that ties the community together.

My vision for Irving is to make it a great place to live not only for us now but far into the future. This means supporting the programs and initiatives that make the community exceptional and attracting new residents who share our values. Together, we can ensure Irving continues to thrive as a place where families and individuals can grow, connect, and flourish.
